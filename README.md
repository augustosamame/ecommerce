# Ecommerce
This engine will add ecommerce capabilities to any of DevTechPeruÂ´s projects.

## Usage
After following installation instructions, a new online store will be available at selected endpoint (ex. /tienda). The main application's Devise user will be available, as well as all main Application Controller methods (and soon helpers). CanCanCan Roles can also be added to Engines own Ability class and they will be merged into main app's Ability class.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ecommerce'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install ecommerce
```

Mount the engine in your routes:

```
mount Ecommerce::Engine, at: "/tienda", as: "ecommerce"
```

User Model

The Ecommerce engine expects the following User model schema to be present:

t.string :email (Devise default)
t.string :password (Devise default)
t.integer :role, default: 0, null: false (for CanCanCan authorizations)
t.string :first_name, null: false
t.string :last_name, null: false
t.string :phone
t.string :username
t.string :address
t.string :doc_id
t.string :avatar
t.integer :status

Assets

for some reason, the application.scss and application.js are not being pulled, so all requires for js and scss should be also placed in main_app application.scss and application.js

ex.

```
application.scss

*= require devise_bootstrap_views
*= require bootstrap-datetimepicker
*= require material_icons
*= require custom_tododanza

application.js

//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require jquery-ui
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
//= require moment
//= require moment/es
//= require bootstrap-datetimepicker
//= require pickers


```


## Migrations

copy over and run migrations with

```
rails ecommerce:install:migrations
rails db:migrate
```

Note: special care needs to be taken when creating and copying over a migration with relations from the namespaced engine, since rails fails to recognize the namespace for the foreign keys. See create_ecommerce_backoffice_variants for a working example
Basically you have to remove the foreign_key: true from the field and add the foreign key manually by using:

```
add_foreign_key :ecommerce_backoffice_product_variants, :ecommerce_backoffice_products, column: :product_id
```
