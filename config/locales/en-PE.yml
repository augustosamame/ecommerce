In particular our focus is on products that are currently not available in Peru and/or over priced in the Peruvian market. We also offer locally produced goods on our online platform, at better prices by working directly with the manufacturer, especially products that we think would be highly appealing to our customer base.</p>"

To disrupt the market by importing selected high demand products and selling them directly to our target consumers (as opposed to using traditional channels), thus keeping our prices at international & locally competitive rates.</p><p>2.      To create a market for products unavailable in the Peruvian arena and provide alternative consumer goods options to those offered locally.</p><p>3.      To provide a robust solution to the inconvenience of bringing certain products as personal items from abroad.</p>"
